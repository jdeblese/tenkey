== Tenkey Controller ==

This is an adapter board and an IO expander for converting an old
number pad for use with a modern PC. The number pad switches are
not wired in a matrix but are rather brought out via a DIL header.
Due to space constraints, and so as to not have to modify the
number pad itself, an I2C IO expander will be plugged into the
DIL header to read out the key state. Firmware on an ATMega32u2
will then pass this on to the computer using the LUFA library
written by Dean Camera. The current firmware is an adaptation
of his USB keyboard example.
